<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Raymond Gareth Saunders Lewis. I am currently working as a carpenter
  and a mentor for children with learning and behaviour difficulties
</p>

<p>I have always been interested in computers and learning more as technology advances which has lead me to this course.</p>

<p>In my spare time I like to go to the gym, watch movies, play video games and socialise with friends.</p>
